My first repository. 
Hi My name is Matt. I am pretty new to Git, but not source control. I have used it in the command line ages ago, but I like the new web layout. I have to say that this is way better the source safe. I have mainly written code in VB6, C++, and C#. I have done some very specific web development for my former company to create user interfaces. I am currently working on web developement for websites. I hope to be able to make a simple webpage with modern tools by the end of today. If you found this page thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a wonderful day, but no pressure, just have the day you're comfortable with.
